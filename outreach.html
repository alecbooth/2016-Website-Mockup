					<h1 class="subTitle"> About WTW </h1>
					<p class="multiParagraph"> CHS TechHOUNDS Robotics Team Launches Women in Technology Workshop </p>
					<p class="italicized"> The Women in Technology Workshop is a conference to encourage
					girls in grades 6-8 to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, and math
					(STEM) with experiential technology curriculum and inspiring speakers.</p>
					<p class="why"> Why WTW?</p>
					<p class="multiParagraph">Making up only 18% of engineers, 19% of computer scientists,
					and 14.6% of executive officers, women are abysmally underrepresented in technology fields.
					Why? <b>Even in this day and age, the misconception persists that science, technology, engineering,
					and mathematics are "male professions</b>".</p>
					<p class="hereToChangeThat"> <b>We're here to change that.</b></p>
					<p class="multiParagraph">The half-day Women in Technology Workshop allows girls in grades 6-8 to
					explore variety of hands-on, technology-focused activities on September 26, 2015. Attendees will be
					given the opportunity to work with other women passionate about STEM fields in a supportive environment.
					Hosted by the Carmel High School TechHOUNDS Robotics Team, the program will feature a coding session led
					by the 1150 Coding Academy, a computer-aided design (CAD) session led by current female engineering
					students, and several other electronics-based team-building activities.</p>
					<p class="multiParagraph">The conclusion of the program includes an interdisciplinary panel featuring
					women in STEM careers or actively involved in promoting STEM education. This panel, including US Congresswoman
					Susan Brooks, Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz, CEO of Go Electric Lisa Laughner, and Systems
					Engineer Praveena Theertham, will discuss how women can achieve success in technology-oriented fields. This
					session is free and open to the general public.</p>
