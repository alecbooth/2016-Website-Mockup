				<h1 class="subTitle"> Mission </h1>
				<p class="Mission">The TechHOUNDS strive to provide an innovative, team-based experience 
				that fosters appreciation and love of STEM through robotics, outreach, and strong team-community 
				relationships, all while developing the technical and communication skills vital in the modern world.</p>

				<h1 class="subTitle"> Who We Are </h1>	
				<p class="multiParagraph">FIRST Team 868 was founded in 2001 by Carmel High School 
				architecture teacher David Smith. With a mere twelve students and a single mentor, the team quickly established a name 
				in the robotics community, winning the Rookie All-Star Award, becoming finalists on Einstein, and soon after garnering 
				support within the Carmel community.</p>

				<p class="multiParagraph">Since then, the team has steadily gained attention and participation, featuring 138 students
				and 38 mentors in the 2016 season. Our students represent a unique, diverse subset of Carmel's population that all have
				a intense passion for STEM fields. We have 42 independent sponsoring companies, and our strong, long-term relationships
				have allowed employees from corporations such as Rolls Royce and Delphi to serve as mentors. This effective team structure
				has allowed us to develop great community relationships, provide STEM experiences to the public, and compete on the highes
				level of FIRST robotics.</p>

				<p class="multiParagraph">In addition, TechHOUNDS is heavily dedicated to spreading the message of FIRST in the community
				by promoting STEM, as well as volunteering to help improve the quality of life for all of our community members. Each year,
				we participate and sustain a variety of outreach events, demonstrations, and activities that make our community better. Our
				current emphasize lies in increasing minority representation in STEM, inspiring young students to pursue STEM education, and
				partnering STEM and special needs.</p>
